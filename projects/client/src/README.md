The client module aims to make setting up an Angular app as painless as possible. That means that instead of spending time setting up a filter algorithm for your autocomplete, you can focus on things like page layout and business logic.

This module uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) for its design and animations and in many cases will simply extend what they already have. As it is a peer dependency, use of the material components should be available for use after importing the appropriate modules.
