	This file is actually used to redirect to our Angular application when a user tries to reload a page or
	navigates to a route directly. The current locaction is stored for use by the index.html file, then the
	session is redirected to the '/' route which will use the stored information to figure out where they should
	be.

		<script>
			// store the URL the user was trying to access when receiving the 404
			sessionStorage.redirect = location.href;
